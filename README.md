## Project Overview

This is an evolutionary simulation that models a population of agents in a 2D world. Each agent's behavior is controlled by a genetically-encoded neural network. The simulation explores how complex behaviors like herbivory, cannibalism, and social dynamics can emerge through evolutionary processes.

### Key Features
- **Neural Network Brains**: Agents make decisions using either a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN) or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), selectable in settings.
- **Genetic Inheritance**: All agent traits, including their neural network weights, are determined by a diploid genome and are heritable.
- **Resource Management**: Agents must find and consume food and water to survive.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Food spawns in drifting clusters, simulating changing seasons or resource patches.
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Behaviors like fleeing, fighting (cannibalism), and mating are not hard-coded but emerge from the NN outputs.
- **Somatic Mutations**: Agents can undergo minor genetic mutations during their lifetime.
- **Genetic Lifespan**: Individual agents have genetically determined lifespans that can evolve over generations.
- **Comprehensive UI**: Full-screen settings interface with categorized parameters, scrollable controls, and intuitive value adjustment.

## Core Components

### Entities
The simulation contains several entity types that populate the world:

#### Agent
The central entity in the simulation with the following characteristics:
- **Position**: Vector2 position in the world
- **Energy**: Primary resource, consumed by existing and moving. Dies if it drops to 0
- **Hydration**: Secondary resource, drains at a constant rate. Dies if it drops to 0
- **Age**: Increases over time. Dies if it exceeds individual `max_age`
- **Genome**: The agent's complete genetic code
- **Phenotype**: The expressed traits derived from the genome
- **Brain**: The `NeuralBrain` instance, built from the genome
- **Total Mutations**: Tracks accumulated mutations for visual identification

Each agent has a unique appearance based on its species and genetic makeup, with different shapes representing different species (circle, square, triangle, etc.).

#### Food
Simple entities that agents can consume to restore energy. They spawn in clusters that drift over time.

#### Water
Entities that agents can drink from to restore hydration. They are large circular areas with a defined radius.

#### Obstacle
Terrain features that agents cannot pass through, including:
- **Mountains**: Visually represented with elevation bands and snow caps
- **Water barriers**: Represented as rivers or lakes
- **Walls**: Border obstacles that can be enabled/disabled

### Systems
The simulation logic is organized into several interconnected systems:

#### Movement System
- Computes neural network inputs using sector-based sensing
- Performs forward pass through the agent's brain
- Updates agent position based on neural outputs
- Handles collision detection with obstacles
- Applies behavioral drives (avoid, approach, attack, mate)

#### Combat System
- Resolves attacks when agents are near each other
- Damage influenced by size and aggression traits
- Cannibalism allows attackers to gain energy from kills
- Handles mating animations and events

#### Feeding System
- Allows agents to eat food pellets they are close to
- Restores energy based on food value

#### Hydration System
- Drains hydration over time
- Agents replenish hydration when within water sources

#### Energy System
- Applies metabolic costs based on agent size, speed, and efficiency
- Costs scale with effort and activity level

#### Reproduction System
- Manages mating between agents
- Creates offspring through crossover and mutation
- Handles reproductive cooldowns and maturity requirements

#### Aging System
- Increments agent age over time
- Handles death from old age based on genetic max_age

#### Somatic Mutation System
- Applies random, small mutations to agent genomes during lifetime
- Mutations can be inherited if agent reproduces after mutation

#### Disease Transmission System
- Handles spread of diseases between agents
- Different diseases have different effects and recovery rates
- Genetic resistance affects susceptibility

#### Events System
- Manages special events like epidemics
- Triggers based on population density and other conditions

### Genetics
The genetic system is based on diploid chromosomes with the following features:

#### Genome Structure
- **8 Chromosomes**: The genome consists of 8 pairs of chromosomes
- **Brain Genes**: Chromosomes 4 through 7 encode neural network weights:
  - **FNN Mode**: 130 brain genes (96 input-to-hidden + 6 hidden biases + 24 hidden-to-output + 4 output biases)
  - **RNN Mode**: 166 brain genes (adds 36 hidden-to-hidden recurrent weights)
- **Trait Genes**: Chromosomes 0 through 2 encode physical and behavioral traits

#### Reproduction
- Two agents of opposite sex can reproduce if mature, have sufficient energy, and are close
- Reproduction driven by the `mate_desire` neural network output
- Offspring created via crossover and mutation, inheriting mixed parental genomes

#### Mutations
- **Reproductive Mutations**: Occur during reproduction with configurable probability
- **Somatic Mutations**: Occur at low rate throughout agent's life
- **Mutation Tracking**: Accumulated mutations visually represented by increased brightness

### Rendering
The visualization system provides real-time rendering of the simulation:

## Neural Network Architecture

### V2 Architecture Overview
The simulation uses a **V2 architecture** with sector-based sensing and decoupled behavioral drives. Two neural network types are available:

#### Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)
- **Architecture**: 24 inputs → 8 hidden neurons (tanh) → 6 outputs (tanh)
- **Total Weights**: 254 (192 input-hidden + 8 hidden biases + 48 hidden-output + 6 output biases)
- **Purpose**: Reactive behaviors, simpler and faster processing

#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- **Architecture**: 24 inputs → 8 hidden neurons (tanh, with recurrent connections) → 6 outputs (tanh)
- **Total Weights**: 318 (192 input-hidden + 64 hidden-hidden + 8 hidden biases + 48 hidden-output + 6 output biases)
- **Purpose**: Memory-based behaviors, complex strategies with temporal reasoning

### Inputs (24) - Sector-Based Sensing

### Stress System
Agents maintain internal stress that influences behavior:

3. **Combat**: Resolves attacks between nearby agents
4. **Feeding**: Agents consume nearby food
5. **Hydration**: Drains hydration, agents drink from water sources
6. **Energy**: Applies metabolic costs based on activity and traits
7. **Reproduction**: Manages mating between eligible agents

- Agents crossing bottom edge reappear on top
- Optionally, border walls can be enabled to prevent wrapping

### Collision Handling

## Advanced Features

### Body Size Effects (`ADVANCED_SIZE_EFFECTS_ENABLED`)
Makes body size a first-class trait with meaningful trade-offs:

| Perception range | 1.0 + size_norm × SIZE_PERCEPTION_BONUS | 1.0 to 1.1 |

### Superlinear Energy Scaling (`SUPERLINEAR_ENERGY_SCALING`)
Larger agents pay superlinear energy costs:

- Effort amplifies size cost through EFFORT_SIZE_INTERACTION

### Age-Dependent Modulation (`AGE_EFFECTS_ENABLED`)
Implements life-history stages:
- **Young** (0.0-0.2): 70-100% speed/stamina, 80-100% experience, 50-100% reproduction
- **Prime** (0.2-0.6): 100% in all areas
- **Old** (0.6-1.0): Reduced speed/stamina, increased experience, reduced reproduction

### Internal State Modulation (`INTERNAL_STATE_MODULATION_ENABLED`)
Soft penalties based on resource levels:
- Energy < 20%: Attack effectiveness reduced to 50-100%
- Hydration < 30%: Speed reduced by up to 30%
- High stress: Short-term effort boost (fight-or-flight)

### Action-Specific Cost Asymmetry (`ACTION_COSTS_ENABLED`)

- High speed: 1.5x multiplier
- Sharp turn: 1.3x multiplier
- Pursuit: 1.2x multiplier
- Attack: 3.0 base cost
- Mating: 5.0 base cost

### Morphological Trade-offs (`MORPHOLOGY_TRAITS_ENABLED`)
Two new evolvable traits:
- **Agility** (0-1): Affects turn rate, acceleration, and metabolic cost
- **Armor** (0-1): Provides damage reduction but penalizes speed and increases metabolic cost

### Sensory Imperfection (`SENSORY_NOISE_ENABLED`)
Adds realistic perception limitations:
- Gaussian noise added to sector signals
- Chance of sensor dropout
- Noise on internal state perception

### Context Signals (`CONTEXT_SIGNALS_ENABLED`)
Additional NN inputs tracking time since key events:
